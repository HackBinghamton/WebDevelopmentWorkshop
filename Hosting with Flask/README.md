# Hosting Webpages with Flask
## Overview

### What You'll Learn
In these sections, you'll learn
1. How webservers work, and how to set up a Flask webserver
2. How to use "templates" (custom HTML and CSS) with Flask
3. How to take user input into your Python programs through Flask

### Prerequisites
Before starting these sections, you should have an understanding of
1. Have Python installed (see "Before We Start" below)
2. [Python Basics](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop)
3. [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/tree/master/Intro%20to%20HTML%20and%20CSS) (for parts 2 and 3)

### Introduction
In these sections, we'll discuss hosting web content with Flask servers, how to use custom HTML/CSS with them, and how to take input into your own Python code from users and send output back to them.

## Before We Start
Make sure that you have Python 3 and Flask installed.

The latest version of Python 3 for your OS can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
If using Linux of some variety, try to install it through your package manager (e.g. apt-get, pacman, etc.) instead of downloading from the website.

Once Python is installed, open the command prompt and run 'pip3 install Flask'.

You should be good to go!
