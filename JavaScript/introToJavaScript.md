### The Very Basics of JavaScript: Introduction & Hello World
For this tutorial we will be using a basic framework of HTML, some CSS and JavaScript to run and test our code. The website [Codepen](https://www.codepen.io/) perfectly fits this description.

Navigate to the website and click the **Start Coding** button. You will be redirected to an interface with HTML, CSS and JavaScript panels, a console, and a segment of the screen that shows the front end result of your code <!-- last part needs to be reworded idk how to describe it !-->. For now we will focus on the console and JS panel.

In the JavaScript panel, type ```console.log("Hello World")```. Make note that JavaScript syntax is similar to Python in that semicolons are optional in most situations. The above statement will run with or without one. If you open the console now, you will see it has printed the string ```"Hello World"```.

Another thing you can do with JavaScript is create browser alerts. Type ```alert("[Your message here]")``` in the JavaScript panel and you will get a popup from the website with the message.

Example:
```
alert("HEY!")
```
Returns

Lets also discuss comment syntax. Comment syntax in JavaScript is the exact same as in C, Java and other languages. Single line comments are made with ```//Your comment here```, and multi-line comments are made with ```/* Your longer comment here */```.
