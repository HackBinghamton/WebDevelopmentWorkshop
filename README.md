## HackBU - Web Development

# Getting Started

In this workshop we will be
tackling several topics relating to web development. Specifically, we will
focus on an introduction to HTML/CSS for anyone with little to no web development experience. For those with a bit more experience we have a intermediate section that may involve knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and a few common libraries such as AJAX and jQuery. Lastly, we will take a look at ReactJS for those experienced with web development.
<br /> <br />
Not sure where to start? <br /> <br />
Our workshop is comprised of 3 separate segments, each with their own mini-projects, tutorials, and topics.
<br />
We are covering HTML/CSS for novices, where we focus specifically on building a personal website and deploying it with
Github Pages. Building a personal portfolio can be a great way to separate yourself in the job/internship search. You can
use your site to showcase your resume, contact info, and side and classroom projects. Plus, Github Pages is a free, easy way
to deploy webpages.
<br />
For those who may already feel comfortable building static webpages with HTML/CSS, we invite you to check out our intermediate section. Vanilla JavaScript (native, standards-based) is a really powerful language for DOM manipulation. While HTML and CSS are useful for designing static web-pages, JavaScript is integral for making those sites interactive. This includes tasks like manipulating text dynamically, listening to events, adding functionality to buttons, and data persistence. We've also linked to some resources on the document object model, and its relevance.  
<br />
Lastly, we have a React workshop for those experienced with the aforementioned topics. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. However, this label is a bit reductionist. React has a ton of its own libraries and packages, each of which alter its capabilities significantly. Inevitably, we won't be able to touch upon all of the libraries we'd like to given our time constraints, but I'd implore you to look more into React with the resources below, or contained on the React page itself, it's quite thorough and well-written.

# Today's Projects

Today's workshop is all about web development. After completing this workshop,
we'd like you to feel a bit more comfortable with using the technologies we take a look at.
For novices, we hope that you
build off of our workshop to create your own personal website, either hosted on Github, or externally. Our JavaScript segment is designed to help those already knowledgeable on HTML and CSS feel comfortable with front-end JS and manipulating the DOM. Our mini-projects include: <br />
Beginner:   <a href="GithubPagesGuide.md">Building a Personal Website and Hosting it with Github Pages</a> <br />
Beginner:   <a href="HTMLCSSminiProject.md">Building a Personal Website and Hosting it with Github Pages</a> <br />
Intermediate:   <a href="ReverseEngineering.md">Taking a Website and Building it from Scratch</a> <br />
Advanced: <a href="README.md">Building a React Single-Page App (SPAs)</a>

React: <br />

For anyone that is interested in a deeper-dive into React.JS, this guide, (also created by a HackBU member) has a ton of useful information. It's a comprehensive overview on React and includes topics like npm, custom CSS, backend API integration, components, PWAs, and deployment. <br />
