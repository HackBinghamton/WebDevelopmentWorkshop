# HackBU - Web Development

## Getting Started

In this workshop, we will be tackling several topics relating to web development -- from laying out and decorating webpages with HTML to hosting them and interacting with user input using Flask and JavaScript!

## Building Webpages
These sections will teach you the fundamentals of writing static webpages -- from layout and visual design with HTML and CSS to adding some simple interactivity with JavaScript. 

### [HTML and CSS](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/tree/master/Intro%20to%20HTML%20and%20CSS):
You'll learn how to build beautiful, static websites with HTML and CSS, and how to create forms (which we'll use later with JavaScript and Flask)!

### [Vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/blob/master/JavaScript/introToJavaScript.md):
You'll learn to use basic JavaScript syntax, take user input, give output, interact with HTML, and more!

### [Hosting with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/tree/master/GitHub%20Pages%2C%20Domain%20Names%2C%20and%20Jekyll):
Now that you know how to build a webpage, you'll learn how you can host a personal website for free using GitHub Pages!

## Building Web Applications
These sections will show you how to build more interactive websites, like a to-do list and a Zalgo text generator! With what you learn here,

### [React.js](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/tree/master/React.js):
Here, you'll learn how to build a basic to-do list using React, one of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks in the industry.

### [Hosting with Flask](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/WebDevelopmentWorkshop/tree/master/Hosting%20with%20Flask):
Host your HTML/CSS/JS and handle user input on the server side with Flask, a Python web back end.
