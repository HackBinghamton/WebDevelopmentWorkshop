# Website Hosting Resources

Take advantage of the [Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)!!

As a student, Github provides access to a very large amount of tools for free!

Some of these include free domain names from popular domain websites:
* [name.com](https://www.name.com/partner/github-students) - One free domain name and free Advanced Security
* [namecheap](https://education.github.com/pack/offers#namecheap) - 1 year domain name registration on the .me TLD and 1 year SSL certificate (For example: firstNamelastName.me)
* [.tech domains](https://get.tech/github-student-developer-pack) - One .TECH domain free for 1 year.

The benefit of creating a Github Pages website and having access to free domain names is that you can redirect your website to the domain name!

For example, if your Github Pages website is accessible from johnsmith.github.io, and you want to change it to johnsmith.me (using a free namecheap domain), you can do that in your repository settings.

Follow along with [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages) from Github to complete the setup.
